5) Upload files: "Add file" → "Upload files" → drag in index.html, styles.css, script.js
6) Click "Commit changes"
7) Go to: Settings → Pages (left sidebar)
8) Under "Build and deployment": Source → "Deploy from a branch"
9) Branch: "main" ; Folder: "/" (root) → Save
10) Wait ~1 minute. A green link will appear like:
    https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/andreas-evite/
11) Share that link as your evite!

CUSTOMIZE LOOK & FEEL
- Open styles.css and adjust the color variables at the top (e.g., --candy-red, --candy-green).
- Increase/decrease snow by editing FLAKES in script.js.

TIPS
- Most email clients block animations/JS. Send the link rather than embedding the page in an email.
- You can also generate a QR code that points to your link and put it on printed invites.
